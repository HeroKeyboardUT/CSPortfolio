                This is a project that I have done in the subject of Discrete
                Structure. The project is about Finding the shortest path to
                visit all the cities in the map.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Algorithm used in this project is Branch and Bound so it is
                guaranteed to find the optimal solution. But the time complexity
                is relatively high so it is not suitable for large input(>20
